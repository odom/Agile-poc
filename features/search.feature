Feature: Provide a Search
  In order to search for pages and page content
  As a website visitor
  I want to find results based on my query

  Scenario: Search is displaying result statistics
     Given I am on "home"
     When I fill in "tx_indexedsearch[sword]" with "Home"
     And I press "Search"
     Then I should see "error"
     #Then I should see "Displaying results"
